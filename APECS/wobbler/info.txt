- The wobbler blank/sync signal is generated by the TSGEN and it is not slaved to the 1pps
  or any other timing signal since we allow arbitrary frequencies between 0 and 2 Hz.

- The wobbler positions are read every 4 ms and written to the MONITOR-MBFITS tables.

- The MONITOR table data have MJD-TAI time stamps. The current TAI to UTC difference is 37 s (stored
  in MBFITS too), so that one can calculate UTC. In addition to that data one needs to know
  which phase was on and which one was off source. This is defined in the PHASE1/PHASE2
  keywords in SCAN-MBFITS and optionally in the DATAPAR-MBFITS table headers if the assignment
  changed for different subscans due to a symmetric wobbling mode.

 - I attach a small script to extract the wobbler positions and out put UNIX UTC time and
   wobbler position in arcsec. The BoaMBFits module is part of the BoA installation that
   one can activate via
       source /soft/astro/boa/initboa.[c]sh
   on the MPIfR machines.

 - At APEX the phase 1 wobbler position is always positive and the phase 2 one is negative
