* skedf.ctl - sked/drudg program control file
*
* Last modified by NRV 951002 for FS9 
*
* This file is free-field except for section names
* which must begin with $ in column 1 and have no
* blanks.  Either upper or lower case is OK for section names.
* Remember path and file names in UNIX are case sensitive.  
*
$catalogs 
* Note: The $catalogs section is used by sked but not by drudg.
*
$schedules 
*
* Enter the path name for schedule (.skd) files. If not specified,
* the default is null, i.e. use the local directory. Both sked and
* drudg look for schedules in this path.
*
/usr2/sched/
*
$drudg
*
* DRUDG file path:
* Path for snap and proc
$snap
/usr2/sched/
$proc
/usr2/proc/
$scratch 
*
* Scratch directory:
* Enter the absolute path for scratch files. 
* This path is prepended to scratch files by SKED and DRUDG.
*
/tmp/
*
$print
*
* Printer commands: enter printer type for drudg.
* Recognized names: laser, epson, epson24, file. 
printer      laser
*
* Printer scripts: enter name of script to be executed 
* for different types of output. Recognized key words
* are: portrait, landscape, labels. If no label script
* is specified, drudg defaults to using "lpr". If no
* portrait or landscape scripts are specified, drudg
* defaults to embedding escape sequences for the
* appropriate output and uses "recode latin1:ibmpc"
* piped to lpr to print the output file. 
* Formats: 
* portrait <script name for portrait output>
* landscape <script name for landscape output>
* labels <script name for bar code label output>
***label_printer postscript
label_printer dymo
portrait      lpr -Phplj2 $*
landscape     lpr -Phplj2 $*
*labels /usr2/control/dymolab.pl
labels     /usr2/control/printdymo.pl
* This example is for a laser printer, 6 lines/inch, 10 char/inch:
*portrait lpr -ofp10 -olpi6 $*
*landscape lpr -ofp10 -o1pi6 -olandscape $*
* These examples are the same as above but for a smaller font:
*portrait lpr -ofp16.66 -olpi6 $*
*landscape lpr -ofp16.66 -o1pi6 -olandscape $*
*portrait <script name for portrait output>
*landscape <script name for landscape output>
*
* Output control:
* Enter the desired orientation and font size for listings. Key words
* are option1, option4, and option5 for the three listing options.
* Follow the key word by a 2-letter code, first letter "p" or "l" for
* portrait or landscape, second letter "s" or "l" for small or large
* font. If none are specified, the defaults are as listed below:
*option1 ls (landscape, small font)
*option4 ps (portrait, small font)
*option5 ps (portrait, small font)
*
* Label size:
* Specify label size parameters, only valid for "postscript" type. If
* no size is specified, drudg cannot print labels.
* <ht> height of a single label, in inches
* <wid> width of a single label, in inches
* <rows> number of rows of labels on the page
* <cols> number of columns of labels on the page
* <top> offset of the top edge of the first row of labels from the 
*      top of the page, in inches
* <left> the offset of the left edge of the first column of labels
*      from the left side of the page, in inches
* Format:
* label_size <ht> <wid> <rows> <cols> <top> <left>
*label_size  1.61  4.11    7     2    -0.8   0.10   Zweckform 3477
*label_size  1.3889  3.90    1     1    0.0   0.0   Dymo

*This is for dealing with Mark5 data transfer issues.
*Default directory for the disk2file command.
*Note shell expansions like "~" will not work, use absolute pathnames,
*     relative pathnames may work if you are careful about the working
*     directory of the Mark5A program.

*     NO:  never prompt, use the specified period for all schedules
*     YES: prompt for the period for all schedules and use

*   period
*     <value>: specify the TPI sampling period in centiseconds, 0=off

* examples:
*       prompt? period

* tpicd  NO      100   <<<<<<< always use 1 sec period
* tpicd  YES      0    <<<<<<< prompt for period, default is OFF
