The setup.py and MANIFEST.in are files used with distributing and packaging
python modules.

With the command:

python setup.py sdist -> will create a source distribution
python setup.py bdist_rpm -> will create the appropriate source and binary 
	redhat distribution 

To create a Debian Distribtion we recommend following the PackagingGuid/Python 
tutorial. Specifically following the CDBS and debhelper guidelines.
