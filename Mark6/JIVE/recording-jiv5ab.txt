Looks like you're on the right path! In short: no the initial loss is not actually expected.

Because I don't know exactly what you've done so far, I may be stating 
the obvious below, apologies in advance. Thing is that 16Gbps does 
require a fair bit of configuring, not difficult but all necessary, 
otherwise packets are lost.

Initial packet loss could be caused by not having set the Linux buffers 
large enough and also you have to make sure that dplane is not running!

Also making sure that the network card interrupts are serviced by one 
core (or each network card assigned to a specific core, that is best). 
And you must make sure that jive5ab is running on the remaining core(s) 
of the same physical CPU. (And make sure that hyperthreading is switched 
off - these HT cores are fine for computing but for I/O they're absolute 
worthless and actually make it worse.)

On the Mark6 it is automatically started as a service, I have noticed. 
But it hogs so many resources that ~8Gbps jive5ab can do with the 
remainder but 16 is out of the question.

Concerning your configuration: set nthread to ~4. That should be enough. 
I have noticed that if the number of disk writers gets too large you 
actually get a decrease in throughput - the threads are (apparently?) 
fighting for the resources. We could (easily) sustain with 3 to 4 
writers.
