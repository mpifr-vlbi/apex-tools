This describes how to rebuild the network and modules (netinfo.so, and m6sc.so) 
python wrappers that are used by c-plane so that also other
functions can be added.

To build and install the wrappers simply run as root or sudo:
python setup.py install
python m6scsetup.py install

to build the wrapper locally:
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
python m6scsetup.py build_ext --inplace

More information to come.
