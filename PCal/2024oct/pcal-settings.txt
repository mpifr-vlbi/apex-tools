Spectrometer view (XFFTS) on VNC:

  New N3AR 86G receiver:
    vnc server:  ffts3:2
    passwd:      ... same as ffts1


Harmonic mixer (HM) used for NFLASH and SEPIA
has 3+10 dB (13 dB) worth of attenuators attached.

This prevents inadvertently frying the HM when
the synthesizer level gets accidentally set too high.

Synthesizer power should be ramped up/down in
small steps to be delicate on the HM!

Power      -20 dBm
Frequency  17219 MHz
RF On
Power, ramp up with up/down arrows in slow e.g. 0.05 dBm steps to   +19.15 dBm

Tone should be visible on   XFFTS screen #5   at ~3700 MHz

Switch off tone:
  Power ramp down with up/down arrows in e.g. 1 dBm steps down to -20 dBm
  Finally, RF Off
