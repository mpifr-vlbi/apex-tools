Dear Jan and all,

Just to add some extra information to what Kalle sent. 
In the function getCalResult(FeBe, index, 0) the parameter 'index' is actually the baseband. 
In the case of nFLASH230 this can only take the values: 1,2,3 and 4.

As Kalle described:

The baseband 1 and 2 correspond to the 4-8GHz IF sections
The baseband 3 and 4 correspond to the 8-12GHz IF sections 

One of the parameters the getCalResult() function returns is the 'feeds' array with two values (as all other parameters). 
The first element of the arrays correspond to the X polarization (or pol 0 if you like); while the second element correspond to the Y polarization (or pol 1). The values of the 'feeds' array can also be only 1,2,3 and 4, with 

feeds=[1, 2] - the X and Y pol of the LSB sections
feeds=[3, 4] - the X and Y pol of the USB sections

So, by combining the baseband input parameter and the returned feeds values, you can reproduce the CLASS labels of the IF sections. For instance, when giving baseband=2 you will get feeds=[3,4].. this correspond to the CLASS labels (or telescope names): AP-N203-F102 and AP-N204-F102 in the plots that Kalle sent.

Regarding the tSys values, they are an average (over the IF section) Tsys value, and they are not tau-corrected. However, you can get the corresponding opacity values (also an average over IF) in the (returned) two-element arrays: tauSig and tauIma.

Hope this helps with the monitoring script.

Cheers,
JP

Hi Jan, I had a look and compared with the latest calibration, if I got it right the mapping is:

onlineCal.getCalResult('NFLASH230-FFTS1',1,0)
[0, 1] - [LSB 4-8GHz Pol X, LSB 4-8GHz Pol Y,]

onlineCal.getCalResult('NFLASH230-FFTS1',2,0)
[0, 1] - [USB 4-8GHz Pol X, USB 4-8GHz Pol Y,]

onlineCal.getCalResult('NFLASH230-FFTS1',3,0)
[0, 1] - [LSB 8-12GHz Pol X, LSB 8-12GHz Pol Y,]

onlineCal.getCalResult('NFLASH230-FFTS1',4,0)
[0, 1] - [USB 8-12GHz Pol X, USB 8-12GHz Pol Y,]

So, the 1,0 you had in your script corresponds to LSB 4-8 GHz for Pol X and Pol Y (or 0/1).

See attached file with the full output and the calibration/pointing scan I used for the mapping.

Cheers Kalle

Hi Jan,

it is NFLASH230-FFTS1 and MonitorQuery.

I am currently on leave, reading mail only rarely.

Cheers,

Dirk
